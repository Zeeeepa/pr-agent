# PR Review Automator UI Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PR Review Automator UI. The goal is to ensure the UI works correctly after fixes, verify functionality, and prevent regression issues.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will focus on testing individual UI components in isolation.

#### Components to Test:
- Dashboard
- Navigation tabs
- Settings dialog
- Theme toggle
- Event system components
- GitHub workflow components
- AI Assistant components

#### Testing Approach:
- Use React Testing Library and Vitest
- Test component rendering
- Test component props and state
- Test user interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
- Test conditional rendering

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify that components work together correctly and that the UI interacts properly with the backend.

#### Areas to Test:
- Component interactions
- API service interactions
- State management across components
- Event handling between components

#### Testing Approach:
- Use React Testing Library for component integration
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to mock API responses
- Test data flow between components
- Test state updates across components

### 3. End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests will validate complete user workflows and ensure the application works as expected from a user's perspective.

#### Workflows to Test:
- Dashboard navigation
- Settings configuration
- Event trigger creation and management
- GitHub workflow interaction
- Theme switching
- Error handling and recovery

#### Testing Approach:
- Use Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing
- Create test scenarios that mimic real user behavior
- Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### 4. Visual Regression Tests

Visual regression tests will ensure the UI appearance remains consistent and detect unintended visual changes.

#### Areas to Test:
- Component appearance
- Layout and positioning
- Theme switching
- Responsive design
- Animation and transitions

#### Testing Approach:
- Use Storybook for component visualization
- Implement Percy or Chromatic for visual regression testing
- Create baseline screenshots for key UI states
- Automate visual comparison in CI/CD pipeline

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Testing Infrastructure

   - Set up test server for integration tests

3. **Configure E2E Testing**
   - Install and configure Playwright or Cypress
   - Set up test environment for E2E tests
   - Create helper utilities for common operations

4. **Set Up Visual Testing**
   - Install and configure Storybook
   - Set up Percy or Chromatic for visual regression testing
   - Create initial baseline screenshots

### Phase 2: Implement Component Tests

1. **Create Test Utilities**
   - Create render helpers
   - Create user interaction utilities
   - Create mock data generators

2. **Implement Tests for Core Components**
   - Dashboard component tests
   - Navigation tab tests
   - Settings dialog tests
   - Theme toggle tests

3. **Implement Tests for Feature Components**
   - Event system component tests
   - GitHub workflow component tests
   - AI Assistant component tests

### Phase 3: Implement Integration Tests

1. **API Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions with API services
   - Test error handling for API failures
   - Test loading states during API calls

2. **Component Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between related components
   - Test state propagation between components
   - Test event handling across components

### Phase 4: Implement E2E Tests

1. **Critical User Flows**
   - Dashboard navigation flow
   - Settings configuration flow
   - Event trigger management flow
   - GitHub workflow interaction flow

2. **Error Handling Flows**
   - Test recovery from API errors
   - Test form validation errors
   - Test authentication failures

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
   - Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### Phase 5: Implement Visual Regression Tests

1. **Component Stories**
   - Create Storybook stories for all components
   - Document component variants and states
   - Create visual test cases

2. **Visual Regression Tests**
   - Set up Percy or Chromatic in CI/CD
   - Create baseline screenshots
   - Configure visual diff thresholds

### Phase 6: CI/CD Integration

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Configure GitHub Actions for running tests
   - Set up test reporting and visualization
   - Configure code coverage reporting

2. **PR Validation**
   - Run tests on PR creation and updates
   - Block merging if tests fail
   - Report test results in PR comments

## Test Documentation

### Test Documentation Plan

1. **Testing Guide**
   - Document testing approach and tools
   - Provide guidelines for writing new tests
   - Document common testing patterns

2. **Test Coverage Report**
   - Generate and maintain test coverage reports
   - Identify areas needing additional testing
   - Track coverage metrics over time

3. **Manual Testing Checklist**
   - Create a checklist for manual validation
   - Document test scenarios not covered by automation
   - Provide steps for reproducing and verifying fixes
