# Webhook Setup and Real-time Notifications Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PR-Agent's webhook setup and real-time notifications module. The module is responsible for receiving instant notifications when repository events occur, such as PR creation, updates, or merges.

## Test Environments

1. **Local Development Environment**
   - Local FastAPI server with tunneling support
   - Mock Git provider APIs for controlled testing

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Deployed webhook server with real Git provider connections
   - Controlled test repositories for triggering events

## Test Categories

### 1. Webhook Registration Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| WR-01 | Verify automatic webhook setup for GitHub repositories with admin access | Webhook is successfully registered with correct event types |
| WR-02 | Verify webhook secret generation and storage | Secret is securely generated and stored |
| WR-03 | Test webhook registration with invalid permissions | Appropriate error message and fallback behavior |
| WR-04 | Verify webhook configuration for PR events | Webhook is configured to receive only relevant PR events |
| WR-05 | Test webhook registration across multiple repositories | All repositories are properly configured |

### 2. Tunneling Support Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| TS-01 | Test ngrok tunneling initialization | Tunnel is established and URL is properly configured |
| TS-02 | Verify webhook URL update with tunnel URL | Webhook configurations are updated with tunnel URL |
| TS-03 | Test fallback to localtunnel when ngrok fails | Seamless fallback with appropriate logging |
| TS-04 | Verify tunnel reconnection after network interruption | Tunnel is re-established and webhook continues to function |
| TS-05 | Test tunnel URL validation | Invalid tunnel URLs are rejected with appropriate error messages |

### 3. Asynchronous Processing Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| AP-01 | Verify background processing of webhook events | Events are processed without blocking the main thread |
| AP-02 | Test response handling to prevent webhook timeouts | Quick acknowledgment response before processing |
| AP-03 | Verify concurrent webhook handling capabilities | Multiple webhooks are processed correctly in parallel |
| AP-04 | Test event queuing during high load | Events are properly queued and processed in order |
| AP-05 | Verify processing of events after server restart | Unprocessed events are recovered and processed |

### 4. Error Handling Tests

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| EH-01 | Test webhook validation failures | Appropriate error responses and logging |
| EH-02 | Verify error logging mechanisms | Errors are properly logged with context information |
| EH-03 | Test recovery from temporary API failures | Automatic retry with exponential backoff |
| EH-04 | Verify circuit breaker pattern for API resilience | Circuit opens after threshold failures and recovers |
| EH-05 | Test handling of malformed webhook payloads | Graceful error handling without server crashes |

## Test Data

1. **Sample Webhook Payloads**
   - PR creation events
   - PR update events
   - PR comment events
   - PR merge events

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Invalid signatures
   - Malformed JSON
   - Timeout simulations
   - Rate limit exceeded

## Test Implementation

Tests will be implemented using pytest with the following structure:

```
tests/
  webhook/
    test_registration.py
    test_tunneling.py
    test_async_processing.py
    test_error_handling.py
    conftest.py  # Test fixtures and utilities
```

## Mocking Strategy

1. Git provider APIs will be mocked using `pytest-mock` or similar libraries
2. HTTP requests will be intercepted using `requests-mock` or `httpx-mock`
3. Webhook events will be simulated by sending requests directly to the FastAPI test client

## Continuous Integration

Tests will be integrated into the existing CI pipeline to ensure webhook functionality is not broken by future changes.

## Manual Testing Checklist

Some aspects of webhook functionality require manual testing:

- [ ] Verify actual webhook delivery from GitHub/GitLab/etc.
- [ ] Test real tunneling with ngrok in development environment
- [ ] Verify webhook processing under real-world network conditions
- [ ] Test recovery procedures after server downtime
